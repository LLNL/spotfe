# SPOT Front-End

This is the front-end code for SPOT, a web-based visualization tool for performance data.  The SPOT front-end
is a forked and heavily modified version of dc.js:

https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/

You likely don't want to check out this repo directly, unless you're making changes to SPOT.
It's instead recommended to get the spot_container and let it check out this repo as a submodule.
To build SPOT into a container see:
