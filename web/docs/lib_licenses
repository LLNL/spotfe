I did not look at any of the pyhton modules:
argparse, json, sys, os, platform, subprocess, getpass, urllib.parse, socket, time

but I think these all go under the python license.
Python License:
"The Python License is similar to the BSD License and, while it is a free software license, its wording in some versions meant that it was incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL) used by a great deal of free software including the Linux kernel. For this reason CNRI retired the license in 2001, and the license of current releases is owned by the Python Software Foundation License.[2]"


9. Grunt - MIT License
Bower - MIT License
