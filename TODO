next:
DONE - alphabetize the the checkboxes, so you dont have to hunt.
DONE - Added Labels: Groupby and Label xAxis for the select drop downs.
BINS - I made some progress on bar chart bins -> this means you don't need to see those super skinny bars where the width is just 1 point on the x-axis on a 1000 point xrange graph
    * It works like this: If the X-range is more than 30 it will sub-divide into 20 bins
    * note: there's still 2 minor bugs with this: the leftmost bucket doesn't always show up and the right most bucket only shows 1/2 of it sometimes, hence why the iterations chart looks blank.
    * Sub-Integer charts still work like they did before
DONE - Added commas to really large numbers.
DONE - made x-axis 45 degrees vertical
DONE - for X-axis: match date to duration format of the other spot page.  (multi-line, OR vertically)
DONE - put the correct format of date in table - not the unix epoch time.
DONE - spot2 redirect or deploy there and level it up 1 step from web/
    * https://lc.llnl.gov/spot2/
    * https://rzlc.llnl.gov/spot2/?sf=/usr/gapps/spot/datasets/lulesh_new

RECENTLY DONE:
DONE - alphabetize the drop down.
DONE - Table HTML -> for the pieCharts and barCharts - maintain left/right position.
DONE - dynamic table row show/hide fix.
DONE - Added Dev and Prod URLs to documentation url list, to make it easier to remember the URLs.


List of Joe's working on:
- Compare page x-axis and groupby drop downs not populating
- Jupyter call not returning stuff
- Durations call not returning stuff
- Getting the following to not crash: RZ ONLY: ~/testresults
- Figure out why the Summary JSONP call is taking 8 seconds to respond.


Next:
- if sf file is not there then spit out an error.
- for now an input box.  "Please provide a directory that contains dot cali files."
- Naming of Barchat => dimension ("Iteration")
    * don't mess up the URLs (dont use BarChart0, BarChart1, etc)
- LeftMost BIN does not show up.
- RightMost BIN is cut in half for some reason.
- File Upload browser on landing Page.
- Apply xUnits to sub-integer charts.
    * this should fix the not being able to save bucketed charts.
- xTics astethetics, don't show 1.2,1.4 in the 1,2,3 data
- Nulls
- STrings plus more than 12 unique values then we need to have a left horizontal bar.



HIGHEST TODO:
TEST: 1. On Date Type show date instead of 1e9
3. From UserPreferences Module -> make table change right away.
    * Load all columns, then hide the ones not checked: $('._4').hide()/ .show()
    * when the person checks a checkbox or uncheckboxes it.
0. Fix Iterations -> xUnit()  -> set # of buckets.
2. Ideally set the bar width
    * Next best option is to get the Bar Off the Y Axis, by having the range be +/- 5%
3.5 Be able to have a date type to show date (month/year) if layout says it's a date.
3.6 X-tics take a look if it's just integers?
=================================================================================
4. Naming of Barchat => dimension ("Iteration")
    * don't mess up the URLs (dont use BarChart0, BarChart1, etc)
5. Redirect from /spot2 to our deployment area.
    * https://lc.llnl.gov/content/
    * spot2 -> I already made the content directory request.
6. File upload browser on landing page.
7. Make tic marks at the beginning of the barChart.
9. On the Spot1 page, be able to change the xAxis and GroupBy URLs based on the select drop down change.
10. Currently NO support for SubInteger URL -> because it uses bucketing.
    * this means you can't run the dashboard if that's being used
11. Some day do NULL.


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15191258/properly-display-bin-width-in-barchart-using-dc-js-and-crossfilter-js

Things to watch out for:
- is duration key quoted
- are you signed in with a user that is WCIuser group.


TODO/ Feature Requests:
DONE: 00. One color - http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3
DONE: Firefox Fix.
DONE 2. Sub integer support
DONE 0. That last X-axis ranges make sure it's not 5.3 when it's seperated by 1 tick
DONE 3. Reset All link should reset all URL parameters.
- Think about container graphs and Preferences to X-out a Graph.
- Document whether it uses buckets OR standard.
2. be able to accept very small differences in data values, like: 2.702 to 2.705, etc.
    * Generate some super small data sets on the FE, can that be done easily?
    * Add one chart to the layouts and one on the Data array-> just add one more attribute in the range of 2.7465 and 2.7459
1. Y-axis Ranges should be selected better.
-  Need to fix: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded    crossfilter.js: 1353.
5. Do study on if we can have a range selector on a bucketed chart.
8. What about a date selector dropdown?  X number of days.  Instead of last_days=XXX
5. On the Spot1 page, be able to change the xAxis and GroupBy URLs based on the select drop down change.
6. Get a Real date and show it as some kind of selectable chart or at least a drop down.
3. Store layout Preferences: which are changes for example: being able to not show certain charts.
    -> Preferences which allow you to kill things in the Table.
4. Instead of BarChartX, need to go by dimension name so that it doesn't break whenever the user adds a new data attribute
8. Deal with maximum call stack size exceeded error.
9. LAST: Ravel calculation of Lateness is inverted.




Caveat:
- Must remain in the same browser in order to pull up results because we store cali files in localStorage
    * storage in URL is not an option if we have too many cali files.
    * Eventually we'll want to store that on the BE, come up with an architecture for that.





- DONE Announce last_x_day feature, plus the exe_compare=1 feature.
- DONE X range -> take the distance from Min to Max (1% or 3%) of the distance (from Min to max) and add to the max xrange
- DONE Table Sorting bug, fix this. -> this is because the first letter is capitalized, so when it goes to sort, it doesn't recognize the string.
    * prevent dc.js auto capitalize?

- DONE 1. Get Date Data and make sure it shows up in spot2 and spot1
- DONE 2. Drop downs for xAxis and GroupBy
- DONE 3. Send XAxis and GroupBy to spot1
- DONE 4. Receive XAxis and GroupBy on spot1
- DONE 5. on spot1 use those 2 to populate the page.

- DONE 6. when dropdowns are selected, update the URL
    ST.UrlStateManager.update_url('xaxis', )
    * this needs more testing.

- DONE 7. when URL has xaxis and groupby propogate them to the select drop down.
- DONE 8. on spot2 page make sure to add "exe_compare=1" to URL, plus add xaxis and groupby as well.


9. - Add all BarChartX and PieChartX to compareURL.

- Fix firefox/safari browser problem: regUlral expression.

- Work with chavez to get the spot1 page up and running again.

- Retest last_days=XX

10. - Deal with maximum call stack size exceeded error.

11. Be able to graph X-axis of less than 1 int width.
    * as part of this need to be able to subdivide the bars into widths of 0.1 or 0.2, etc.

12. On the Spot1 page, be able to change the xAxis and GroupBy URLs based on the select drop down change.




- Get Date data from boehme and use that.
- Some way to generically specify the "date" field for last_days
- When they click compare, send "hey, I want X-axis to be VAR"  VAR Should be some field the user selects.
    * Initially let's specify it on the URL parameters, later we let them select dropdown it.
- Consider some kind of Calendar or Date selector chart that would be able to select dates, rather than just the URL parameter.
- exe_compare=1 find a way to add this to bookmark.
    * make some kind of bookmark button.

- Joy Kiton - (David Boehme) 13th, 14th (Figure out what is 17th -> 21st).


Think about: Time Series / Line Graphs
    * estimate on this.
    * Max pressure over time.
    * maybe 12 line graphs per graph.


- DONE: Labels for X and Y axis
- DONE for figure of Merit try to round down.
- DONE replace "willEmailYou ToComplain" with "pascal", filler0 (matt) and filler1 (david)
- DONE 1e7, 1e8 abbreviations for Num of Iterations.

DONE since last time.
- DONE Fixed Title for graph
- DONE y ticks, x ticks - you can roughly specify the number of ticks you want
- DONEish buckets.  Needs more testing and shake down.
- DONE Arrows to the left of each of the Table headers.
- DONE - fixed table sorting bug for strings that should be numbers (did some type coercion on data in ajax return handler)
- DONE - fixed table not showing all values bug: was due to maximum was set to 250 even though there were 5000 values.
    * Chart Collection Line 264.  It still showed up in the bar charts but not the table.  Once max was increased to proper value, then all values show up even after being sorted.
- DONE - sort_as_number feature.


Figured out:
Debugged David boehme's issue:
http://localhost:8888/web/?sf=/g/g0/pascal/spot_lulesh_dataset/lulesh_data&layout=/g/g0/pascal/spot_lulesh_dataset/layout.json
    * It would appear that somehow the X-scale is not being set correctly for some reason.
    * This was due to the fact that the data was "90","120" so it tried to treat it as a string, which caused it to find out the max and minimum incorrectly.

- Another Issue: When sorting Problem size ("90","120"), etc the sorting is incorrect because it sorts it as a string, not a number.


RECENTLY DONE:
- Updated some documentation
- Send Tammy the Documentation.
- Refactor ajax interface to allow for more parameters, in preparation for command option
- Allow them to specify command dynamically in URL.
- Get Optviz working:
    * Cloned OptViz repo onto LC, and set up permissions script
    * created new index.html file
    * hacked some of the JS links
    * figured out the right input files to use.
    * and got it operational with some hacking: https://lc.llnl.gov/lorenz_base/dev/pascal/optvis/templates/
- DONE: Got MPI working on CZ.



TODO LIST
=================================================
- Joy Kitson -> make some trips there. (Matt here mon,tues,wed)  Matt leaving thursday
    * she's coming on monday.  first week is LTrain, getting a system, cafeteria, dada.

- Check Left column to make sure that it's not hard coded.
- Hi Pascal! I get a syntax error in Spot2 in ChartCollection.js:78:32 in Firefox. It doesn't like the regex there. Works fine in Chrome.
- Need to get access to /usr/gapps/spot/datasets  (dzpolia currently owns it)  I can't add layout files there.
- Bar Charts different colors for each one.
- may 3rd is David Poliakoff's last day
- Units.
- Bucketing algorithms.
- Floating point numbers on the X-Axis.
    * Bucketing might fix this issue, if we make sure to use whole numbers.
- Jupyter/MPI clicking on CZ.
- Write some stuff about the front end:
    - visualizations that we can do
    - the data and layout interface.
- be able to run on CZ:
    - default cz to cz jsonp
    - default rz to rz jsonp
- Work on Sorting, data needs to work with the following:
    {"Compiler Version": {
        label: "6.1.1",
        value: 6001001
    }
        * support just value as well.
        * look into in-place sort.
- Ravel: Expand entity lanes so that we can make it more vertically spaced.
    * set height of this element: physical split split-vertical physical-div to 1800px
- put help in it's own vue file.
- Once sabin sends index.html, i can try and launch it.
    * what would it take to run it on LC, give it a try.
- Start providing support for larger MPI files: /g/g0/pascal/lulesh/lulesh_ravel_traces
    * Support actual render, make sure it can handle the data render.
- Labels -> instead of the cali key, try specifying the field based on the last sorted field on the spot 2 page.
- Integration: send cali file run IDs.  this specifies which ravel trace to use by the cali file name.
    * This Integration won't be possible until we have those files in the proper location with the right cali filenames.
    * After that, I should be able to just pass in the location of the file with absolute directories: /g/g0/pascal/lulesh/lulesh_ravel_traces/xxxxx.cali
- Error message: “If you don’t have an account on [whatever the specified machine was], try picking a machine you have access to, like [the current URL]&machine=rzslic,” essentially debugging messages. Low priority, but useful.
- Host on Both RZ and CZ.
- Group By?  need to ask exactly what this is.
- Find a way to do in-order sorting.
    * Investigate: Is there an option for this?
    * Can we specify a sort function?
- Icons
- tooltip suggestion from Tammy Dahlgren
- Custom X-axis titles.

- Fixed Title overlapping Graph Bug.
- A few minor error message modifications.

RAVEL:
- Pass cali_key to ravel page and prep it to be sent to BE.
- First pass of reductionSplicer which reduces the events and messages to a certain step index for example 0 - 100.


Future features:
1. Allow user to specify columns with some UI widget
2. Chart overlap issue
3. Ability to overwrite column names on table (aliases)

Error reporting feature:
 was helping Dan Laney through using the Spot 2.0 page, I started him at this URL

https://lc.llnl.gov/spot/dcvis/web/?sf=/usr/gapps/spot/datasets/lulesh2small&layout=/usr/gapps/spot/datasets/enhanced_layout.json

First he got the “log in to the RZ” message, which confuses people, while still being a good error message. It would be nice if we could have an RZ and a CZ hosting.

Then he got a “Lorenz Error, failed to run command…” message, which came from him not having an account on Genie. This was easily solvable, but it might be nice to add warnings like
“If you don’t have an account on [whatever the specified machine was], try picking a machine you have access to, like [the current URL]&machine=rzslic,” essentially debugging messages. Low priority, but useful.

Also really nice work on the error messages, it was possible to talk Dan through a session over Jabber pretty easily, that’s paying dividends.

Best,

David P
