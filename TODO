Do I need to use "AdditionalMachineAccess":
https://myconfluence.llnl.gov/display/RAM/AdditionalMachineAccess

How to get a FIS account:
https://myconfluence.llnl.gov/display/RAM/FIS#FIS-DoIhaveaFISaccount?
Left Off: Sent the form to Jeff.  Waiting for approval, so I can start using Hopper to do deployments (still need the directories of where to move stuff).

Next:
- Make sure Matt's Demo on thursday can use DEV.
- Bring up: talk about: Nathan.  Compare functionality does work for their data.
DONE 1. SCF:  Fis.
- Fix link to Documentation
- Check default machine to make sure RZ isn't required for CZ.
2. Integrate with Joe Chavez.
    7. On page load make sure that whatever default tab is open is shown and the other one is fully hidden.
    9. Propate URL changes to drop downs on page load.
    10. Do lots of testing.
2. Spot Scalability - to 1 million.
    * I need the AJAX request to not timeout -> which means, getting the request time down to about 5 seconds or less.
3. Update the optvis deployment
4. Optvis -> use the script that Matt provides: a c++ program executable that i will run that will generate a file that i should delete after reading
    * command_out -> will contain the output of the command of this program.
    * the input files, I'll get them from a different source, probably embedded in the JSON.
    *
5- Possibly Unknown Priority number - Later on Scalability of Optviz.
    * make sure to pass Matt a UserID
    * make sure to tell him when session has closed, or assume it's closed 5 min after no action.
    * send session start to matt.
1. FIXED - Support Undefined values (some cali's have them defined, some don't)
    * "not defined", 0 if Int.
    * make some test files to test it.

3PM meeting 4159 Morgan Territory.

List:
DONE - Fixed Nathan's customers problem about the strange key names with (2,4): in it.
DONE - Reset link needs to not appear after reset_all was clicked. (horizontal barcharts)
DONE - Rebind "show more" after any selective event occurs -> like you select a pie chart or a bar chart or something.
DONE - Show more optimization -> make it so it doesnt makea  summary call, just use the data we have.
DONE - finished training: https://caas.llnl.gov/mycaas
DONE - 9. Create a testing index.html page. * Make all tests RZ.   * email Nathan to get spot.py URL for them.
DONE - get SCF accounts -> Jeff -> deploy spot there.
    * md5 sum to see if it pushed correctly.
    * through FIS (file interchange service) into SCF
    * DONE Get SCF account then do this: https://lc.llnl.gov/confluence/display/RAM/FIS
    * DONE access to machines + Livit meeting for SCF access.
DONE - be able to remove existing files.
DONE - 0. Licensing for icons, check.
DONE - 4. Fix wrap fo the horizBarChart
DONE - 5. Be able to owverwrite exiting cali files.
DONE - 6. (one working case is there) Fix compare page for cali files -> make sure tmepalte is not included.
DONE - 7. More template paramters.
DONE - 8. Add a curve, so it's not homogenous for bar Chart
DONE - add curve to horiz bar chart and pie chart.
10. Integrate with Joe Chavez.
9. Fix [brackets] for command line, it's not showing up. (make sure it's not a problem in dc.js)
- Fix horizontal brackets lining up with the actual bar charts.
- Test Data the Jupyter notebooks don't seem to work.

Eventually:
Memory stuff.

Rooms: 2069, 4009, 4013, 4017
The easiest way to use FIS:
On RZ, use the ts alias I created.

On an RZ system: tar up your data into a tar file.
On RZ system: scp myfile.tar rzfis:TO/ (use your LC username and RZ OTP)
scp dc.tar rzfis:TO/dc.tar    # use RZ token.

Wait ~10 min
On SCF system:
ssh pascal@cslic
sftp pascal@fis  (use LC username and SCF OTP)
cd FROM
get myfile.tar
rm myfile.tar
quit

/usr/gapps/spot



32000 entires takes 46s to load.
14500 entries take 24 seconds to load, slight delay when checkboxing.
10000 entries take 16 seconds to load
2000 entries take 3.85 seconds to load
95000 got a gtaeway time-out probably because it took too long.


- make deployment group owned by spotdev
    * group should be rwx
    * world should be r x
    * chmod -R g+rwX,o+rX the-base-dir
    * chgrp -R spotdev

How to use:
cd /usr/global/web-pages/lc/www/spot/dcvis/generate/
python3 MakeCali.py 4905

https://lc.llnl.gov/spot/dcvis/index.html?sf=/g/g0/pascal/lulesh_gen/15

next:
DONE - alphabetize the the checkboxes, so you dont have to hunt.
DONE - Added Labels: Groupby and Label xAxis for the select drop downs.
BINS - I made some progress on bar chart bins -> this means you don't need to see those super skinny bars where the width is just 1 point on the x-axis on a 1000 point xrange graph
    * It works like this: If the X-range is more than 30 it will sub-divide into 20 bins
    * note: there's still 2 minor bugs with this: the leftmost bucket doesn't always show up and the right most bucket only shows 1/2 of it sometimes, hence why the iterations chart looks blank.
    * Sub-Integer charts still work like they did before
DONE - Added commas to really large numbers.
DONE - made x-axis 45 degrees vertical
DONE - for X-axis: match date to duration format of the other spot page.  (multi-line, OR vertically)
DONE - put the correct format of date in table - not the unix epoch time.
DONE - spot2 redirect or deploy there and level it up 1 step from web/
    * https://lc.llnl.gov/spot2/?sf=/usr/gapps/spot/datasets/lulesh_new
    * https://rzlc.llnl.gov/spot2/?sf=/g/g0/pascal/testresults


RECENTLY DONE:
DONE - alphabetize the drop down.
DONE - Table HTML -> for the pieCharts and barCharts - maintain left/right position.
DONE - dynamic table row show/hide fix.
DONE - Added Dev and Prod URLs to documentation url list, to make it easier to remember the URLs.
DONE - if sf file is not there then spit out an error.
DONE - for now an input box.  "Please provide a directory that contains dot cali files."
DONE - Naming of Barchat => dimension ("Iteration")
DONE - xTics astethetics, don't show 1.2,1.4 in the 1,2,3 data
DONE - Fixed LeftMost BIN does not show up.
DONE - Fixed RightMost BIN is cut in half for some reason.
DONE - Apply xUnits to sub-integer charts.  This means you can now select ranges on sub-integers.
    * this should fix the not being able to save bucketed charts.
DONE - bug fixed: filter brush selection is limited to integers instead of allowing anywhere.
DONE - If you mis-type a path from the rzlc.llnl.gov/spot2 dialog, it takes you to rzlc.llnl.gov.  It should instead just print an error.
DONE - Need to have multiple requests to send all the cali files.

------------------------------------------------------
DONE - Optimize the FE loading of charts to prevent long loading times
DONE - prevent alert, and show in screen, if no user actions yet, don't say "got 0 data points."
    * key: if no user actions yet.
DONE - fix case where you only have 1 cali file.

/usr/gapps/spot/spottempw key chunk# data
- attempt to throw as many as possible.

Next:
DONE - turn off the 100 limit
DONE - Update -> URL parameters.- On the compare page, be able to change the dropdowns URLs based on the select drop down change.
DONE - Regression test the last N Days
DONE - TEST and roll out S2.

DONE - Need to support multiple selections for URL loading (also need to encode all those special characters in cmdline variable)
DONE - add URL loading and saving


- physicsstr and "test" - STrings plus more than 8 unique values then we need to have a left horizontal bar in place of the pieChart.  make it scroll.
    * allow for scrolling if too much (right now it scrolls the whole way, but it would look better if it scrolled only the main chart interior part)
    * test for 100s or 1000s of values.
    * test multiple horizontal scrollbar graphs.
- make color based on a hash of the graph name.
- Make sure Spot page supports 10K.
    * Paging of the Table, can we do just top 100, 200, etc.
        * or does it need actual paginated tabs?
    * Joe: Working on pageing of the table.
    Joe is owrking on showing the compare on the actual spot2 page where the table is now.
- Icons - actual icons
- File Upload browser on landing Page.
- Curves & Sets - figure out how to show this in crossfilter (sets is one of the things)
- work on Joe Chavez being able to roll out: S2.


- Nulls
    * assuming we create a newbar with a lower bar, we'll have a problem:
    * if someone gets new data, "what is considered a null" will change.
    * if we make the lowest bucket (null bucket) min int, we won't have to worry about going up to the URL bar.
- it'd be nice if the tics would line up with the bar charts.
- think about 10,11,12 xrange if you only have 11s, think about 1 value graphs and how to make it obvious to user of what it is.
- spin notification

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15191258/properly-display-bin-width-in-barchart-using-dc-js-and-crossfilter-js

Things to watch out for:
- is duration key quoted
- are you signed in with a user that is WCIuser group.


TODO/ Feature Requests:
DONE: 00. One color - http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3
DONE: Firefox Fix.
DONE 2. Sub integer support
DONE 0. That last X-axis ranges make sure it's not 5.3 when it's seperated by 1 tick
DONE 3. Reset All link should reset all URL parameters.
- Think about container graphs and Preferences to X-out a Graph.
- Document whether it uses buckets OR standard.
2. be able to accept very small differences in data values, like: 2.702 to 2.705, etc.
    * Generate some super small data sets on the FE, can that be done easily?
    * Add one chart to the layouts and one on the Data array-> just add one more attribute in the range of 2.7465 and 2.7459
1. Y-axis Ranges should be selected better.
-  Need to fix: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded    crossfilter.js: 1353.
5. Do study on if we can have a range selector on a bucketed chart.
8. What about a date selector dropdown?  X number of days.  Instead of last_days=XXX
5. On the Spot1 page, be able to change the xAxis and GroupBy URLs based on the select drop down change.
6. Get a Real date and show it as some kind of selectable chart or at least a drop down.
3. Store layout Preferences: which are changes for example: being able to not show certain charts.
    -> Preferences which allow you to kill things in the Table.
4. Instead of BarChartX, need to go by dimension name so that it doesn't break whenever the user adds a new data attribute
8. Deal with maximum call stack size exceeded error.
9. LAST: Ravel calculation of Lateness is inverted.




Caveat:
- Must remain in the same browser in order to pull up results because we store cali files in localStorage
    * storage in URL is not an option if we have too many cali files.
    * Eventually we'll want to store that on the BE, come up with an architecture for that.





- DONE Announce last_x_day feature, plus the exe_compare=1 feature.
- DONE X range -> take the distance from Min to Max (1% or 3%) of the distance (from Min to max) and add to the max xrange
- DONE Table Sorting bug, fix this. -> this is because the first letter is capitalized, so when it goes to sort, it doesn't recognize the string.
    * prevent dc.js auto capitalize?

- DONE 1. Get Date Data and make sure it shows up in spot2 and spot1
- DONE 2. Drop downs for xAxis and GroupBy
- DONE 3. Send XAxis and GroupBy to spot1
- DONE 4. Receive XAxis and GroupBy on spot1
- DONE 5. on spot1 use those 2 to populate the page.

- DONE 6. when dropdowns are selected, update the URL
    ST.UrlStateManager.update_url('xaxis', )
    * this needs more testing.

- DONE 7. when URL has xaxis and groupby propogate them to the select drop down.
- DONE 8. on spot2 page make sure to add "exe_compare=1" to URL, plus add xaxis and groupby as well.


9. - Add all BarChartX and PieChartX to compareURL.

- Fix firefox/safari browser problem: regUlral expression.

- Work with chavez to get the spot1 page up and running again.

- Retest last_days=XX

10. - Deal with maximum call stack size exceeded error.

11. Be able to graph X-axis of less than 1 int width.
    * as part of this need to be able to subdivide the bars into widths of 0.1 or 0.2, etc.

12. On the Spot1 page, be able to change the xAxis and GroupBy URLs based on the select drop down change.




- Get Date data from boehme and use that.
- Some way to generically specify the "date" field for last_days
- When they click compare, send "hey, I want X-axis to be VAR"  VAR Should be some field the user selects.
    * Initially let's specify it on the URL parameters, later we let them select dropdown it.
- Consider some kind of Calendar or Date selector chart that would be able to select dates, rather than just the URL parameter.
- exe_compare=1 find a way to add this to bookmark.
    * make some kind of bookmark button.

- Joy Kiton - (David Boehme) 13th, 14th (Figure out what is 17th -> 21st).


Think about: Time Series / Line Graphs
    * estimate on this.
    * Max pressure over time.
    * maybe 12 line graphs per graph.


- DONE: Labels for X and Y axis
- DONE for figure of Merit try to round down.
- DONE replace "willEmailYou ToComplain" with "pascal", filler0 (matt) and filler1 (david)
- DONE 1e7, 1e8 abbreviations for Num of Iterations.

DONE since last time.
- DONE Fixed Title for graph
- DONE y ticks, x ticks - you can roughly specify the number of ticks you want
- DONEish buckets.  Needs more testing and shake down.
- DONE Arrows to the left of each of the Table headers.
- DONE - fixed table sorting bug for strings that should be numbers (did some type coercion on data in ajax return handler)
- DONE - fixed table not showing all values bug: was due to maximum was set to 250 even though there were 5000 values.
    * Chart Collection Line 264.  It still showed up in the bar charts but not the table.  Once max was increased to proper value, then all values show up even after being sorted.
- DONE - sort_as_number feature.


Figured out:
Debugged David boehme's issue:
http://localhost:8888/web/?sf=/g/g0/pascal/spot_lulesh_dataset/lulesh_data&layout=/g/g0/pascal/spot_lulesh_dataset/layout.json
    * It would appear that somehow the X-scale is not being set correctly for some reason.
    * This was due to the fact that the data was "90","120" so it tried to treat it as a string, which caused it to find out the max and minimum incorrectly.

- Another Issue: When sorting Problem size ("90","120"), etc the sorting is incorrect because it sorts it as a string, not a number.


RECENTLY DONE:
- Updated some documentation
- Send Tammy the Documentation.
- Refactor ajax interface to allow for more parameters, in preparation for command option
- Allow them to specify command dynamically in URL.
- Get Optviz working:
    * Cloned OptViz repo onto LC, and set up permissions script
    * created new index.html file
    * hacked some of the JS links
    * figured out the right input files to use.
    * and got it operational with some hacking: https://lc.llnl.gov/lorenz_base/dev/pascal/optvis/templates/
- DONE: Got MPI working on CZ.



TODO LIST
=================================================
- Joy Kitson -> make some trips there. (Matt here mon,tues,wed)  Matt leaving thursday
    * she's coming on monday.  first week is LTrain, getting a system, cafeteria, dada.

- Check Left column to make sure that it's not hard coded.
- Hi Pascal! I get a syntax error in Spot2 in ChartCollection.js:78:32 in Firefox. It doesn't like the regex there. Works fine in Chrome.
- Need to get access to /usr/gapps/spot/datasets  (dzpolia currently owns it)  I can't add layout files there.
- Bar Charts different colors for each one.
- may 3rd is David Poliakoff's last day
- Units.
- Bucketing algorithms.
- Floating point numbers on the X-Axis.
    * Bucketing might fix this issue, if we make sure to use whole numbers.
- Jupyter/MPI clicking on CZ.
- Write some stuff about the front end:
    - visualizations that we can do
    - the data and layout interface.
- be able to run on CZ:
    - default cz to cz jsonp
    - default rz to rz jsonp
- Work on Sorting, data needs to work with the following:
    {"Compiler Version": {
        label: "6.1.1",
        value: 6001001
    }
        * support just value as well.
        * look into in-place sort.
- Ravel: Expand entity lanes so that we can make it more vertically spaced.
    * set height of this element: physical split split-vertical physical-div to 1800px
- put help in it's own vue file.
- Once sabin sends index.html, i can try and launch it.
    * what would it take to run it on LC, give it a try.
- Start providing support for larger MPI files: /g/g0/pascal/lulesh/lulesh_ravel_traces
    * Support actual render, make sure it can handle the data render.
- Labels -> instead of the cali key, try specifying the field based on the last sorted field on the spot 2 page.
- Integration: send cali file run IDs.  this specifies which ravel trace to use by the cali file name.
    * This Integration won't be possible until we have those files in the proper location with the right cali filenames.
    * After that, I should be able to just pass in the location of the file with absolute directories: /g/g0/pascal/lulesh/lulesh_ravel_traces/xxxxx.cali
- Error message: “If you don’t have an account on [whatever the specified machine was], try picking a machine you have access to, like [the current URL]&machine=rzslic,” essentially debugging messages. Low priority, but useful.
- Host on Both RZ and CZ.
- Group By?  need to ask exactly what this is.
- Find a way to do in-order sorting.
    * Investigate: Is there an option for this?
    * Can we specify a sort function?
- Icons
- tooltip suggestion from Tammy Dahlgren
- Custom X-axis titles.

DONE
1.  Genericize the CallSpot.js so it can be used in any project
2.  Enable usage of CallSpot.js from new dur_sankey along with the parameters.
3.  Construct STUB data from CallSpot: spot.py durations2 <filepath1.cali> [filepath2.cali]*
4.  Get dur_sankey working with the STUB data.
5.  Get dur_sankey working for any filepathX.cali
6.  Make Spot 2 compare button and extract all runIDs/filepathX.cali
7.  Integrate Spot 2 cali extraction with the new dur_sankey project page.
8.  Ravel with new API integration, now able to make post request ad handle response, use response to show graph.

RECENTLY DONE:
- Allow the person to specify an Endpoint to call, an input box for dan laney.
- Fixed Title overlapping Graph Bug.
- A few minor error message modifications.

RAVEL:
- Pass cali_key to ravel page and prep it to be sent to BE.
- First pass of reductionSplicer which reduces the events and messages to a certain step index for example 0 - 100.


Future features:
1. Allow user to specify columns with some UI widget
2. Chart overlap issue
3. Ability to overwrite column names on table (aliases)

Error reporting feature:
 was helping Dan Laney through using the Spot 2.0 page, I started him at this URL

https://lc.llnl.gov/spot/dcvis/web/?sf=/usr/gapps/spot/datasets/lulesh2small&layout=/usr/gapps/spot/datasets/enhanced_layout.json

First he got the “log in to the RZ” message, which confuses people, while still being a good error message. It would be nice if we could have an RZ and a CZ hosting.

Then he got a “Lorenz Error, failed to run command…” message, which came from him not having an account on Genie. This was easily solvable, but it might be nice to add warnings like
“If you don’t have an account on [whatever the specified machine was], try picking a machine you have access to, like [the current URL]&machine=rzslic,” essentially debugging messages. Low priority, but useful.

Also really nice work on the error messages, it was possible to talk Dan through a session over Jabber pretty easily, that’s paying dividends.

Best,

David P
